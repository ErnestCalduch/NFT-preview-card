## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and variables for the colors
- Flexbox
- Mobile adapted

### What I learned

- Different ways to work with flexbox based on a fixed multi-column layout
- Making full use of CSS variables (colors)
- Working with the visibility of overlay DIV's
- Making an element stick to the bottom of page

### Continued development

I'd like to refine and perfect the visibility control of hidden elements.
